## How to use:

- Download 'main.py'
- Create a folder and move there the file 'main.py'
- Then create folder 'images'
- Inside 'images' folder create folders named from '1' to '12'

It should looks like this:

- 'folder_name'
    - main.py
    - images
        - 1
        - 2
        - 3
        - ...
        - 12


If image doesn't have datetime in exif it will be skipped and you have move it manually.
